This is a syntax file for the rc shell scripting language.

Most of the work is done by Andy.  I have only made some minor changes to make this syntax highlight works with Byron Rakitzis' reimplementation.

For unix (not plan9) users, there are two slightly different rc available.  One is plan9port's version and the other is Byron Rakitzis' (as packaged by Debian and other *nix software distribution).  This syntax file is compatible with both versions.  (There is a minor tradeoff: less powerful `(ba)sh like substitution` syntax error detection. For a pure syntax file" for p9p, see: http://lug.rose-hulman.edu/svn/misc/trunk/config/spenceal/vim/ )

Tips for using rc shell in Vim (this is not related to syntax directly, but I think users who codes rc shell script in Vim may have interests):

Add the following lines to your .vimrc:

set shell=/usr/bin/rc\ -l
"  or /bin/rc or /usr/local/bin/rc or /opt/local /bin/rc, etc
set shellcmdflag=-c
set shellpipe=>[2=1]\|\ tee
set shellredir=>%s\ >[2=1]
